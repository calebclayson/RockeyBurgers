                reflection of our promise of creating fast food burgers using slow food values.

                The potatoes we use to make our French fries are made from potatoes grown in North America by growers who are required to
                identify the genetic source of their seed potatoes. We do not work with genetically modified potato varieties.
                Our potatoes are processed fresh off the field and delivered to us without any modifications. We proudly
                serve Sir Kensington ketchup.
